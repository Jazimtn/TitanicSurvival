# TitanicSurvival

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It's a classic problem in the field of data science and machine learning, often used for educational purposes.

## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew.

In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare, to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The `train.csv` file is used for training the machine learning model, while the `test.csv` file is used for evaluating the model's performance. Each row in the dataset represents a passenger, and the columns contain various attributes such as passenger class, age, sex, and ticket fare.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

1. Train the machine learning model:

2. Evaluate the model:

3. Make predictions on new data:

## Results

After training the model and evaluating its performance, we achieved a certain accuracy score on the test set. The performance may vary based on the choice of machine learning algorithm, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.
